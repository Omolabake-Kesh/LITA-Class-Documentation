# MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT AS A STUDENT OF INCUBATOR HUB
## project Title: Lita Sales and Customer Data

## Project Steps: This project will be done in steps. Step 1 Excel Step2 SQL: Structure Query Language. Step3 Power BI

## Project overview
This project is on sales data and customer subscription data.The sales data contains different product having different price tag while the customer subscription data show the subscription type of different customers in the different zones. The sale data contains is on csv file. This project is to have a better understanding of how a huge,duplicated and unclean data can be clean ond be presented,interpreted and summarised to give a meaningful result. By the end of this project i should be able to master the data analysis tools in interpreting and summarising and presenting data appropriately.

## Data Sources
The data set was provided as part of the course to enable us work on a huge data and exploir our acquired skill. The data is selected from a public domain and refereced. My duty is to 
 ensure that the given data is well presented and sunnarised fora better understanding even to the common man.

 ##Tools Used:
 Excel: Microsofoft.
        *For Data cleaning
        *For Analysis
        *Visualization
 SQL: Structured Query Language.
      *For querying of Data.
 Power BI. Measures and Visualization.
 Github: For portfolio Building.
 
## Precaution:
I ensured that the data given to me by my instructors are not altared by external factor even though i will still carryout data cleaning on it.
I ensured that my sysetm is free of virus(es) so as not to corrupt the files given to me.
I Thorougly studied the data and mentally analized what can be done to these data before analysing to give understanding through my presentation and summary, so as to give an informed decision to my client.
I imagined the consequence(s) of a false presentation and summary if the data set is not well cleaned and fiiled with duplicates.

## Caution:
I ensured i work with the Questions of our instructors and to make table where neccessary.
I removed duplicate where neccessry.
I ensure to make headers and make measures where neccessary.
putting my system to the source of power for effective work.

dashboard that highlights these findings.

### Instructions:
o Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize 
total sales by product, region, and month.
o Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and 
total revenue by region.
o Create any other interesting report

### Analysis:
Total number of roll in the data set 40079, Remaining 9921 rolls after removing Duplicates, Converted to Table,did Pivot Table,Total Revenue,
