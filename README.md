# MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT AS A STUDENT OF INCUBATOR HUB
## project Title: Lita Sales and Customer Data.

## Project Steps: This project will be done in steps. Step 1 Excel, Step2 SQL: Structure Query Language. Step3 Power BI.

## Project overview:
This project is on sales data and customer subscription data.The sales data contains different product having different price tag while the customer subscription data show the subscription type of different customers in the different region. The sale data is on csv file. This project is to have a better understanding of how a huge,duplicated and unclean data can be clean and be presented,interpreted and summarized to give a meaningful result. By the end of this project i should be able to master the data analysis tools in interpreting and summarising and presenting data appropriately.

## Data Sources:
The data set was provided as part of the course to enable us work on a huge data and exploir our acquired skill. The data is selected from a public domain and refereced. My duty is to 
 ensure that the given data is well presented and sunnarized for a better understanding even to a common man.

 ## Tools Used:
-  Microsofoft  Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. For Data cleaning
    2. For Analysis
    3. For Data Visualization
 - SQL: Structured Query Language.
      1. For querying of Data.
 - Power BI. Measures and Visualization.
  - Github: For portfolio Building.
 
## Precaution:
- I ensured that the data given to me by my instructors are not altared by external factor even though i will still carryout data cleaning on it.
- I ensured that my sysetm is free of virus(es) so as not to corrupt the files given to me.
- I Thorougly studied the data and mentally analized what can be done to these data before analysing, to give understanding through my presentation and summary, so that my client will be able make an informed decision concerning the data.
- I imagined the consequence(s) of a false presentation and summary if the data set is not well cleaned and fiiled with duplicates.

## Caution:
- I ensured i work with the Questions of my instructors and to make table where neccessary.
- I removed duplicate where neccessry.
- I ensure to make headers and make measures where neccessary.
- putting my system to the source of power for effective work.
- I removed the decimal point of the figure so that my pivot table will be on one sheet to be seen and none will be hidden within the bars

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Step 1: Excel ( Sales Data)
### Summary: In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.

### Instructions:
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize 
total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and 
total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report

## Data Analysis/ Visualization (The Sales Data Set)
Total number of rolls in the data set 40079, Remaining 9921 rolls after removing Duplicates, Converted to Table, I did Pivot Table,Total Revenue, Average and Percentage.

### Other Interesting Report:
- percentage Sales 
- Period Trends
- Percentage Round total sales
  

## Deduction from the Sales Data Set:

The sales Data is very interesting to work on is quick voluminous in number fiiled with repeated entries. There are many factors that can cause repeated values such as file corruption, mental,emotion,pschological health state of the collector and lack of invigilation among others. after,proviing answers to the questions given. I decided to give my interesting report by calculating the percentage total sales and percentage round total sales. I had to study the trend or you may say partern of sales in the peroid or season(Month), it varies in sales. 
However,a particular period or season(Month) was out standing increasingly the month called Febuary(The season of love ðŸ’Œ as is commonly called),now this mean that Families members, friends, huusbands and wivies, boyfriends and girlfriends do competitions in exchange of gifts? ðŸ˜„ 

I dont know there may be other factors too affecting the month of Febuary like buying an item for a birthday celibrant of the month of Febuary amog others. Seeing that the month of Febuary is constantly increasing, I will advise my client to focus more on the month of Febuary by stocking item needed in the month of Febuary for his/her customers so as to make more sale and not forsaking other months too but knowning the items needed by the customers in other months. 

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Step 2: Excel ( Customer Data Set)
### Project 2: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
### Summary: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, 
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI 
dashboard that presents your analysis.

### Instructions:
- Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular 
subscription types.
- Create any other interesting reports.


## Data Analysis/ Visualization (The Customer Subscription Data Set)
Total number of rolls in the Customer data set 41213, Remaining 33787 rolls after removing Duplicates, Converted to Table,did Pivot Table,Total Revenue, Count of customerS, No of subscription, Round total, Cancellation pattern,Revenue by Region and Subscription types.

Fig 2 Customer Subscription: The above picture shows the different type of subscription prefered by different customers in different region

### Other Interesting Report:
- Cancellation pattern
- Round total Revenue
- Number of subscribers
- percentag number of subcribers
- Grand total of each Region

   
## Deduction from the Customer Subscription Data Set:
It is interesting working on the Customer Subscription Data, is fiiled with repeated entries. The Customer subscription data shows the social status and lifestyle of the customers in different regions. There are three(3) subscription; Premium(more expensive), Standard(expensive) and Basic(affodable). It is seen that the South region prefers premium maybe due to their expensive lifestyle or social status, the west region prefers Standard maybe due to lifestyle, while the East and North prefers Basic maybe lifestyle or low income earners.

The East has the highest subscription rate and lowest cancelletion pattern, the North has the highest cancellation pattern follow by South West and East. The East has the highest revenue it is a call to my client to focus more on the East on how best to satisfy them through it brand and also to the South region. The North region has the least revenue,it call for my client to also look into the North to know the cause, how it can improve and also see if there is a competitor of it brand in the same region doing the same by not neglecting the West region .
