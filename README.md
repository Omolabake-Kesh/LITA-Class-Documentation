#Precaution:
I ensured that the data given to me by my instructors are not altared by external factor even though i will still carryout data cleaning on it.
I ensured that my sysetm is free of virus(es) so as not to corrupt the files given to me.
I Thorougly studied the data and mentally analized what can be done to these data before analysing to give understanding through my presentation and summary, so as to give an informed decision to my client.
I imagined the consequence(s) of a false presentation and summary if the data set is not well cleaned and fiiled with duplicates.

Caution:
I ensured to make table where neccessary.
I removed duplicate where neccessry.
I ensure to make headers and make measures where neccessary.
putting my system to the source of power for effective work.
